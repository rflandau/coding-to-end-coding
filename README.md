# coding-to-end-coding
Coding to End Coding (CTEC) is a visual script builder, built to be easy to use and highly extendable.

By default, it supports bash output and a short list of bash commands (see below). However, it has support for any interpreter and single-line command.


## Defaults and Extending CTEC
"commands/bash.ctecblock" is the default file used by the program to populate available commands and select interpreter.
This file contains the bash syntax (and therefore CTEC support) for:
* echo
* mv
* ls
* rm 
* cp
* cd
* grep
* cat
* touch
